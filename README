NAME
    Devel::PatchPerl - Patch perl source a la Devel::PPort's buildperl.pl

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use warnings;

      use Devel::PatchPerl;

      Devel::PatchPerl->patch_source( '5.6.1', '/path/to/untarred/perl/source/perl-5.6.1' );

DESCRIPTION
    Devel::PatchPerl is a modularisation of the patching code contained in
    Devel::PPort's "buildperl.pl".

    It does not build perls, it merely provides an interface to the source
    patching functionality.

FUNCTION
    "patch_source"
        Takes two parameters, a "perl" version and the path to unwrapped
        perl source for that version. It dies on any errors.
